# Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers

## Problem Statement ID: 25010
**SIH 2025 - Smart India Hackathon**

## Overview

The Smart Crop Advisory System is an AI-based multilingual platform designed to empower small and marginal farmers in India with real-time, personalized agricultural advisory services. This system addresses the critical gap in accessing scientific farming guidance, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop selection, pest control, fertilizer use, and market strategies.

## Problem Description

A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for agricultural decisions. This leads to:
- Poor crop yields
- Excessive input costs
- Environmental degradation due to chemical overuse
- Limited access to modern agri-tech resources
- Language barriers and low digital literacy
